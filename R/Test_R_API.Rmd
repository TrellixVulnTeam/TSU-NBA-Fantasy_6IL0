This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
if(!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # install pacman if needed

pacman::p_load('devtools', 'BiocManager', 'tidyverse', 'nbastatR', 'future' )


```

```{r}
# library(devtools)
# devtools::install_github("abresler/nbastatR", force = TRUE)

# plan(multiprocess) 
# df_game_logs_2019_2020 <- game_logs(seasons = 2019:2020)


```
```{r}
create_single_year_game_log.function <- function(){
  log.year <- readline(prompt = " Enter year: ")
  log.year = as.numeric(log.year)
  df_game_logs_selected_year <- game_logs(seasons = log.year)
  df_game_logs_selected_year %>%
    group_by(nameTeam)
  
}

create_single_year_game_log.function()
```

```{r}

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
